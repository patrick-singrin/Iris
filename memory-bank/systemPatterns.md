# System Patterns

## Architecture
<!-- High-level architecture overview. Keep it brief — link to docs/ for details. -->

## Key Design Decisions
<!-- Document the WHY behind major choices. Format: Decision → Rationale -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - **Monorepo with Turborepo** → Shared types between frontend and API, single CI pipeline -->
<!-- - **Server Components by default** → Minimize client bundle, use 'use client' only when needed -->

## Code Conventions
<!-- Patterns that are specific to this project, not generic best practices -->
<!-- Only include things Claude can't infer from reading the code -->

## File & Folder Structure
<!-- Document non-obvious organization patterns -->
```
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- src/ -->
<!--   components/   → Reusable UI components -->
<!--   features/     → Feature-specific modules (co-located logic + UI) -->
<!--   lib/          → Shared utilities and helpers -->
<!--   services/     → API client and external service integrations -->
```

## Testing Patterns
